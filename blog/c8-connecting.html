<h6><strong>Seek first to understand, then to be understood - Stephen R. Covey</strong></h6>

<h6><strong>Based on Chapter 7 - Empathy and the monkey business of brain tangos - 06/03/16</strong></h6>

<h6><strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong></h6>
<p>I think naturally I have been using the basis of these techniques anyways.Perhaps not in the structured way they are presented in this chapter but in a round about way I have been achieving the end result already. It is always good to think the best of people and to want the best for them </p>

<h6><strong>Try empathetic listening  - how did it go </strong></h6>
<p>Naturally, I am a very empathic person so again, I think subconsciously I have already been doing this all along. But it was nice to pay attention to it and really focus on the what the other person was saying and take notice of the feelings that I picked up from our conversation.
 </p>

<p><strong> How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</strong></p>
<p>I really liked the loving kindness meditation exercise and I thought it was very kind and thoughtful but above all very compassionate and along with the just like me meditation I think it can be very valuable when dealing with difficult situations and people.</p>

<h6><strong>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing</strong></h6>
<p>Context - negotiating my work load with my boss for the duration of the bootcamp phase at EDA.
My side - I am still going to work part-time while I am at EDA, my role is remote and not time dependent so I can fit work in around my EDA schedule.  
Their side - My employee is doing a full-time course and will fit their work around that course first and foremost. They will not be able to get back to phone calls and emails until after office hours so I think this could be a problem.
Outcome - If both myself and my employer feel as though the workload is too much whilst at EDA full-time, we will review the situation and off load some of my work if necessary</p>
