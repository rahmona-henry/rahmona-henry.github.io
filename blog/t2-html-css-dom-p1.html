<h4>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h4>
<p>A website is constructed using three main components. The components interact with each other to give you the finished site that you will use or visit.The three components are HTML, CSS and DOM.
A very simple way to describe HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language, is using your body, think of your head, shoulders, arms, torso, legs etc, as structural elements that allow your body to support itself, stand up and remain balanced.CSS-Cascading Style Sheets, can then be described as the clothes you dress or style your body with. For example, the colour and style of the t-shirt you choose to wear or the type of sweater you select. Do you wear jeans or choose to wear a dress, what style of shoes do you choose to go with what you are wearing, what jewellery do you accesorise with etc. DOM stands for Document Object Modelling,this can be described like the pattern a designer ot tailor would use to make clothes to dress and style a person. The pattern is based on the dimensions or elements of the body along with the style or type of clothes that the person had selected to wear. Together all three elements - body, style and the pattern create the finished product i.e the website.</p>

<h4>What is meant by boxifying design?</h4>
<p> When designing a website, you first visualise the site in your mind and imagine how it will look, what elements you will use and how it will be presented to the end user. The next step is taking that conceptual design in your mind and presenting it in a visual form. Using boxifying design you can display each webpage as a series of boxes from the top of the page to the bottom. Each box will represent an element on the page. For example at the very top you would have a header box. The header box could be made up of two further elements like a logo and a line of text, these would be represented by two smaller boxes within the header box. The header box could be followed on by a series of three images in the centre of the page, each represented by its own box and so on until you reach the bottom of the page. The boxes will help to compartmentaise the webpage into areas of work. It is helpful to add HTML code to biggest boxes first working your way down to thr smallest of boxes.</p>


<h4>What is the box model?</h4>
<p>The box model is used when talking about design and layout in CSS.
All HTML elements can be thought of as boxes and the CSS box model is essentially the box that is wrapped around each HTML element. Each box is made up of four parts. Starting from the inside out you have on the inside - Content, surrounded by Paddin (correct spelling in this case), than Borders followed on the outside by Margin. The content of the box is where images and text appears. Paddin clears an area around the content and is transparent.A border then goes around the paddin and content. The margin then clears an area around the margin and is also transparent. THe box model allows us to add a border around elememts and to define space between elements.</p>
