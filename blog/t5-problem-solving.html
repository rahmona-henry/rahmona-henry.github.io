<h4>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h4>

<h6><strong>1. Got blocked on a simple problem:</strong></h6>
<p><strong>What was the problem?</strong></p>
<p>In the Sprint-4 resume builder exercise one of the first tasks was to get familiar with the JQuery method .append by adding your name to #main. The exercise provided a template $("#main").append([Insert Name]); which you used and replaced Insert Name with your own name. I did this and ran the code and it would not work for me.</p>

<p><strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong></p>
<p>I tried reading the error message provided, I tried changing the code around, I Googled similar problems online and I used Slack to ask my cohort what the problem could be.</p>

<p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></p>
<p>Frustratated that I ran into a problem on step one of the task and I could not figure out what the answer was. Annoyed that I was wasting so much time on such a small obvious problem and dispapointed I could not figure out the simple answer myself.</p>

<p><strong>What did you learn?</strong></p>
<p>To really look at the line of code that is causing the problem and think about each piece like a variable almost that can be moved around, pulled in and out, deleted. If I remove # what will happen. If I remove .append what happens. I learned not to be afraid to take code appart and test it so you can figure out the root of the problem - in my case it was the []. THe brackets were just placeholders for teh name and need to be removed from the query once the users name was added.</p>

<h6><strong>2. Solved a problem in an elegant way:</strong></h6>
<p><strong>What was the problem?</strong></p>
<p>For the Javascript racer game in Sprint- 5, I was working on a way to restart the game once a winner was announced. I had found a method online to reload the game called .reload() which was a simple line of code but I was trying to work out where I needed to add this line of code in order to make it work. So I made a simple gameOver function that housed the .reload() method and called the function after a winner was announced.</p>

<p><strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong></p>
<p>I searched online for examples of how this method was used in other peoples code. I tried adding the line of code into parts of main code to see if it would work. I used a pen and paper to sketch out the steps of my code and see where I would logically add this line of code to make the program work.</p>
<p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></p>
<p>I felt surprised that a simple line of code could make something I persieved as complex work so eloquently and easily. It also drove home the idea of how Jquery methods work and how valuable they are when solving complex pieces of code.</p>

<p><strong>What did you learn?</strong></p>
<p>Not to fear trying pieces of code or methods even if they look simple and unassuming.</p>

<h6><strong>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:
</strong></h6>

<p><strong>Psuedocode</strong></p>
<p>This method still feels a little new and awkward to me but it is getting more familiar and feels more valuable each time I use it. I can definitely see the benefits of sitting down and stepping out each of the moves of a piece of code.</p>

<p><strong>Trying something</strong></p>
<p>I enjoy using this approach and most times it unlocks the answer to my problem but sometimes you can only try so much and then you have to ask for help or try something new. Over the past few weeks I have gained more confidence to just try something even if it is way off the answer at least I am trying something that gives me a physical result that could be the clue to my next move.</p>

<p><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong></p>
<p>I don't have a rubber ducky on my desk but there could be a virtual ducky in my mind. When I am stuck on a code problem I run through the lines of code in my head and ask myself what is this line doing? what does it produce? is it necessary to have that line of code? is there another way that I could be approaching this?</p>

<p><strong>Reading error messages</strong></p>
<p>I am getting better at reading error messages with the more errors I make. If I don't understand a particular error message I generally Google it or ask my cohort and I remember the answer or reason for the next time the error crops up.</p>

<p><strong>Console.logging</strong></p>
<p>I need to get a little better at using this method. It feels a little awkward but I just think I need some practice with it as I can definitely see the benefits it provides the times that I have used it.</p>

<p><strong>Googling</strong></p>
<p>I use this method a lot when trying to solve problems or understand problems better. I try and solve the problem myself first and if I am getting nowhere after a certain amount of time I try Googling online to find clues to solve my problem. Sometimes you find full answers which kind of ruins the exercise and feels a bit dishonest but then if you look at a few different ways of solving a problem and figure out the best solution for you but learn and remember the approches other people took it all adds value to your experience in the end.</p>

<p><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong></p>
<p>If I cannot figure out a problem myself or with the help of Google I ask for help from my cohort on Slack. Most of the time somebody else from the cohort has experienced the same problem so a solution is availble which is really helpful and it makes you feel a bit better that you are not the only one experiencing the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong></p>
<p>I feel comfortable asking the coaches for help but first I like to try and solve the problem myself and if not I ask my cohort for help and if that is not helping me solve the problem then I would very comfortable asking the coaches to lend a hand as they are super approachable and helpful.</p>

<p><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong></p>
</p>Reflection is good especially after tackling a tough problem. In a way it gives you an opportunity to look at the problem backwards. Somebody once said "You can't connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future". It's important to reflect and remember that there is no such thing as a wrong move or time wasted on solving a problem. It's all part of the journey and it adds to the overall experience.</p>

<h6><strong>Explain to your non-tech friend - Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:
</strong></h6>

<p><strong>.map()</strong></p>
<p>The .map() method will iterate or move through every item in an array or list and create a new array with values/items that have been modified by some function or process that was applied to the orginal array.</p>

<p><strong>.filter()</strong></p>
<p>The .filter() method is used to iterate through an array and filter out the elements/items where a given condition is not true.</p>

<p><strong>.reduce()</strong></p>
<p>The .reduce() method is used to iterate through an array and condense it down into one value.</p>

<h6><strong>Have a go at explaining how recursion compares to iteration (In your own words)</h6></strong>
<p>Generally speaking, recursion and iteration perform the same kinds of tasks.They both solve a complicated task one piece at a time, and combine the results. Simply put:
Iteration: will use a process that keeps repeating until a task is “done”. It uses loop based repetitions that execute a certain set of instructions repeatedly, without calling the function or method.
Recursion: will solve a large problem by breaking it up into smaller and smaller pieces until it can solve it and then combine the results. Recursion uses a process in which a function or method calls itself repeatedly to execute a certain set of instructions.</p>
