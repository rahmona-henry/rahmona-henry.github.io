<h4>As if talking to a non-tech friend, discuss:</h4>

<h6><strong>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS</strong></h6>
<p>HTML creates the content structure within a website and CSS makes the website look great with visual styling. Both of these are great tools to create static websites but if you want your website to come alive and interact with its users you will need to add some JavaScript. JavaScript gives websites the capabilty have some of the following exciting features:
# Listen to events like pressing a keyboard key and do something.
# Modify the HTML and CSS of a webpage after the page has loaded.
# Make things move around the screen in interesting ways.
# Create interactive games that work in the browser.
# Allow you to interact with a webcam, microphone, and other things.
JavaScript works alongside HTML and CSS to create really interactive websites.</p> 

<h6><strong>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</strong></h6>
<p>In JavaScript, control flow statements make decisions about what happens in a computer program. If, Else and Switch are all examples of control flow statements. In everyday life every decision we make can be modeled as a series of true and false statements. For example: "If the fuel tank in my car is empty today -TRUE: I go to the garage and fill it with petrol. FALSE: I will not go to the garage and fill it with petrol." This everyday example applies to everything your computer does. Control flow statements are the digital equivalents of the decisions we make where ythe computer code does something different depending on whether something is true or false.
Loops in JavaScript repeat an action you want to do again and again based on a condition that is created along with the loop. An everyday example to explain this could be a timer on a lamp in your living room. For the set conditions e.g the hours set on the lamp timer, the light will switch on at the set time and remain on for the set hours and eventually turn off at the set finish time. This cycle will be repeated until the hours set on the timer are changed.</p>

<h6><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</strong></h6>
<p>In JavaScript both objects and arrays can be described as boxes that can store information. Accessing information from an object box is slightly different to accessing information from the array box. This is because as the information gets stored in each box in a slightly differently. For example, if we take the object box and say we want to store cookbooks in the box. The only thing is we have lots of cookbooks from all over the world on different types of cuisine so in order to access or find a particular cookbook easily we must store them in a way that is easy to access them. So we will label the box 'cookbooks' and in the box we are going to store the books by 'country' so if I want to find my Jamie Oliver cookbook I go to the 'cookbook box' go to the 'England' and find my 'Jamie Oliver'book - easy - Cookbooks.England.JamieOliver!To access the values on the object, we use “dot notation”, that is, the name of the object, a dot, and the name of the property followed by its value. 
Arrays store information slightly differently to objects. So for example if I want to store all my wine bottles in wineboxes in my cupboard. So like my cookbooks I want to store my wine bottles in some order. So I take all my Chardonnays and store them in a 12 bottle wine box. So each bottle of Chardonnay has a position in the wine box so I know my Gibbston Valley Chardonnay is in position #1 and my Odyssey Chardonnay is in position #2 etc so all my Chardonanay bottles are found by referencing their position in the wine box -this is called  numerical indexing and it is what Arrays use. </p>

<h6><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</strong></h6>
<p>Functions in JavaScript are like quick, easy go to recipes in a cookbook. For example if you want to make a tomato sauce for your pasta dinner you can go to your recipe book and find your go to tomato sauce recipe, plug in your ingredients and there you have it - your finished sauce. This recipe is one you use every week so its re-useable, groups the same ingredients together - sometimes the volumes are different but you know exactly what the recipe produces everytime you use it. At a very basic level, a JavaSCript function is nothing more than a wrapper for some code. Functions are really useful as they group statements together and makes code reusable.</p>
