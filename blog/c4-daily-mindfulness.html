<h6><strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong></h6>
<p>During my mindfulness conversation I practised the following techniques: 1.Listening -I learned how to really listen without distration or judgement to what the other person was telling me. 2. Looping - I learned how to loop, which means to communicate back and forth with the other person until you really understand and comprehend what they have just told you. An finally 3. Dipping - which meaning 'checking in with yourself'. During conversations with others we can easily get distracted by our own feelings and internal chatter. Dipping encourages us to acknowledge those internal distractions, recogonise that they are present, try not to judge them and let them go away if they willing to go or to just be aware of them if they decide to stay. I found the mindfulness conversation really interesting as did my conversation partner. We both recogonised that we can easily take day to day conversations with people for granted and even though on the surface we may be listening to what other people are saying we are not really clearing our minds and focussing intentently 100% on what the other perosn is really truely communicating to us.</p> 

<h6><strong> Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong></h6>
<p>The one breath a day technique resonated with me the most."Breathe in and breathe out mindfully, and your commitment for the day is fulfilled; everything else is a bonus." This is an easy technique to practise and I feel it is a technique you can easily get better at with some momentum. We breath all day everyday - hopefully! so it is there as a constant reminder and if you can start with one mindful breath a day it is easy to increase that to maybe two a day or a whole 10 mins of mindful breathing. You can also practise this anywhere - home, work, in the car, on holiday etc. </p>
