<h4As if talking to a non-tech friend, discuss:</h4>

<h6><strong>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important</strong></h6>
<p>A responsively designed website is built in such a way that all of the content, images and structure of the site remains the same no matter what device is been used. For example, if you view a site on your desktop, you are getting the full view of the site. But when you visit the site from your smartphone or tablet, the site will retract to fit onto the smaller screen.
Responsively designed websites are becoming more and more important as mobile device usage continues to increase throughout the world. It also provides users with easier to manage sites as the content fits the device they are using which ultimately leads to a better user experience </p>

<h6><strong>What mobile first design is, and why it's important</strong></h6>
<p>Most website design projects are approached from a desktop design side of the project first, while leaving the mobile designed part as a secondary goal that gets accomplished later. Even with the rise of responsive design, many of websites begin their life begin with as “full size” site and work their way to a mobile version. Mobile first design is a growing trend in that flips this workflow on its head and actually begin with mobile considerations first and then work their way to a larger desktop version. 
Mobile first design is important as there is roughly 1.2 billion mobile web users worldwide. Mobile apps have been downloaded 10.9 billion times and mobile device sales are increasing across the board with over 85 percent of new handsets able to access the mobile Web. With those stats in mind it is likely that many users will likely only ever see the mobile version of a site. 
More than ever before the web is something that we carry in our pockets, not something that merely hangs out near our desk or even in our homes. This is a global trend that will only continue to see growth in the coming years. 
</p>

<h6><strong>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons</strong></h6>
<p>Frameworks are used in web design. Most websites are built using similar components and structures.
To save time and extra work frameworks can come packaged or for a simple explanation come as an "out of the box" tool. This means that web developers don't have to start from scratch every time they start a project and instead they can use the out of the box framework to effectively reuse code from project to project. Framework are made up of a structure of files and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) which can be used to support the development of websites.
Frameworks can save developers time and effort, provide solutions to common coding problems, helpful when dealing with collaborative work projects and they provide clean and tidy code. Frameworks are quick and easy to use but they don't really provide developers with a chance to learn the details of the Framework structure or how it is compiled, which can make for a slow learning curve and skills development. Frameworks also have parts that may not be used in a particular project which can be impractical.</p>

<h6><strong>What a wireframe is and why we use it</strong></h6>
<p>Wireframing can be described like the architects drawings of a house. The house drawings will lay out the design of the house, where the rooms are, the sequence of movements and the flow of the traffic it creates. If I go through this door I get into this room which gives me access to the stairs for the upstairs level etc. Wireframing works in exactly the same way, it provides the opportunity to design the layout of a website, how many pages will there be, what is the sequence in which the pages are linked, what position will the content go in, will it be text, images, video etc. Wireframing provides a very broad overview of the design and feel a website without providing the finer details of the content.
Wireframing makes you think about the design and layout of a website, it gives the opportunity to test and refine navigation and see how content lays out on a page. Ultimately it provides an opportunity to really think about the design of a site in more efficient and benificial way instead of just jumping into building something straight away and potential making mistakes as there was no design plan in place.</p>

<h6><strong>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why</strong></h5>
<p> I found the most difficult part to be the planning, actually deciding what you wanted from your site, how your site is going to look like and what features are required. Once that was decided and I had a clear plan in my head of how the site was going to going to look and flow the actual practical  wireframing part was easy.</p>
