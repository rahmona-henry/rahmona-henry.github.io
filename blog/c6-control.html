<h6><strong>"One can have no smaller or greater mastery than mastery of oneself - Leonardo da Vinci"</strong></h6>

<h6><strong>Based on Chapter 5 - Search Inside Yourself - 02/02/15</strong></h6>
<h6><strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong></h6>
<p>This chapter is about developing the skill of 'Self-Mastery' over our emotions and chronicling the journey from compulsion to choice when dealing with difficult and stressful situations. I learned that self-regulation is not just about trying to control your emotions or reactions in difficult situations, it actually goes far beyond that. 

Daniel Goleman identifies five emotional competencies for self-regulation:

1. Self-control: Keeping disruptive emotions and impulses in check
2. Trustworthiness: Maintaining standards of honesty and integrity 
3. Conscientiousness: Taking responsibility for personal performance 
4. Adaptability: Flexibility in handling change
5. Innovation: Being comfortable with novel ideas, approaches, and information

The one barrier that prevents us from successfully achieving these competencies is choice. Our emotions overwhelm or cloud our judgement to move in a different direction away from these qualities. If, however, we have the ability to turn compulsion into choice, then all of these qualities will become available to us.
I learned that self-regulation is really about becoming comfortable and making friends with our emotions. Practices such as the Siberian North Railroad, not feeding the monsters, seeing positives in triggers, all help towards understanding and letting go of our emotions and achieving ultimate 'Self Mastery over ourselves.</p> 

<h6><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness</strong></h6>
<p>I found it relaxing and focused. Everytime I practice mindfulness I get a lot from it. A chance to relax in a very focused way that trains and pushes me to place my mind in the here and now and not let my subconscience distract me with something irrelevant. </p>

<!--<h6><strong>When you were pair programming, did you exercise any of your emotional intelligence skills? </strong></h6>
<p>I have not had the opportunity to pair programme yet but hopefully it will happen this week and I will get the opportunity to practice my newly honed emotional intelligence skills. </p>
