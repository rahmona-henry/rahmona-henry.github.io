<h6><strong>What is grid based design?</strong></h6>
<p>Most if not all websites follow a grid based design. This design method is used to map the layout of your website. The human eye naturally views content on a webpage from right to left and then from top to bottom. If you imagine your webpage as series of rows and columns, just like a grid, the aim of the design method is to the use the grid to arrange and size headers, images, and text in such a way that it creates the most user friendly layout.</p>

<h6><strong>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</strong></h6>
<p> Responsively designed webpages look good when viewed on any device. A responsive webpage can be viewed on a desktop computer, a tablet or smartphone screen and regardless of the screen size (in terms of resolution and pixels) the webpages are going to respond and resize quickly to ensure the page fits the screen, looks good and is legible to the user. Columns, rows, images etc all change their height and width as the browser either gets smaller or bigger. Media Query rules are used to change the CSS of a webpage as the screen changes size or device.</p>


<h6><strong>Semantic structure</strong></h6>
<p>Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in language, in this case HTML. It is important that HTML's "words and phrases" i.e. tags and elements are used and structured in a way that not only do they make sense to the browser but also to the humans looking at them. Semantically structured HTML is HTML where the tags used to structure content are selected and applied appropriately to the meaning of the content.So, for example, if you’re wanting your HTML to be semantically-correct. A paragraph tag pair should only be used to indicate a paragraph (which is a structural concept).It  should never be used to apply space to a web page.
