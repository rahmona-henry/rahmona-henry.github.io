    <h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
    <p>I have never meditated before - so I gave that a try. I also tried the Tiny Habits method and the Pomodoro technique.</p>
    
    <h2>What did you find interesting?</h2>
    <p>I found the Tiny Habits method the most interesting as over time I think it could create the most positive and effective changes.  </p>

    <h2>What worked for you?</h2>
    <p> A combination of the Pomodoro technique and the Tiny Habits method.</p>

    <h2>Which will you experiment further with?</h>
    <p>I would definitely like to give meditation another shot.</p>
