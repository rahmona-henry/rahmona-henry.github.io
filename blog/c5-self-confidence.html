<h6><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong></h6>
<p>In the book Search Inside Yourself, Jon Kabat-Zinn describes mindfulness as "paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally. In the same book, Daniel Goleman describes self-awareness "as a neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions". Both mindfulness and self-awareness require a focused mind and an 'in the moment approach' to the task or the emotion at hand. Mindfulness can be achieved through meditation which can be taught and practised over time so we safely assume that mindfulness can also be taught and practiced over time also.</p> 

<h6><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel? </strong></h6>
<p>I tried body scanning and found it very similiar to meditation. I actually found it easier to practice than meditation as there was a physical outline/structure to focus on. Each meditation can be  different as you can start on a different point on the body and vary the journey choosing which direction you go in. I found I could focus my attention much easier and for a longer period of time in comparison to the other meditation techniques I have practiced before. </p>

<h6><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not me" section?</strong></h6
<p> With lots of mindfulness practice, it is possible to realise and acknowledge that emotions are simply just what we feel, not who we are. Emotions can go from being existential (“I am”) to experiential (“I feel”). With even more mindfulness practice, another important shift may occur and we  may begin to see emotions simply as physiological phenomena. This would mean that emotions become what we experience and go from “I am angry” to “I experience anger in my body.” This change is important because it means we can master our own emotions and experience them in a mindful manner.
