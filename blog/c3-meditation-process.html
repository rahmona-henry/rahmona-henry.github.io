<h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
<p>It was difficult to ignore the need and want to perfect every little, minute detail of the rebuild which included the technical wish list of elements to one side and just focus on the overall project which was to get the actual rebuild completed even in a skeleton/shell form. I had to remind myself to use any spare time at the end week or maybe use the time over the Christmas break to then go back then to focus on wish list items I did not get done or elements that did not quiet work for me this week.</p>

<h5>Chapter -2 -Search Inside Yourself</h5>
<h5>What did you think about mediation before reading chapter 2</h5> 
<p>Meditation is a relativley new exercise for me and I have only tried it a handful of times. I thought it was something that relaxed your body and mind and that was about it. I enjoyed reading this chapter on it though as it explained simply the resons why you should meditate, how you should meditate and it also gave you some insight into the history of meditation and the personal and scientific benefits of doing it.</p>


<h5>What new things have you learnt about mediation</h5>
<p>I have learned that there is a link between meditation and attention and meta attention -which is the paying attention of attention. I have also learned that attention is like a muscle you have to train.
I also learned that meditation has lots of benefits, it increases your attention space, your happiness, and your brain function. It can also reduce stress and provide medical benefits.</p>


<h5>Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you</h5>
<p>Yes, the process of creating an intention either for yourself or others, the seven point posture technique and the four step plan to deal with distractions.</p>

<h5>Any other musings</h5>
<p>I am looking forward to reading the next of Search Inside Yourself.</p>
