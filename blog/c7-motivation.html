<h6><strong>The Art of Self-Motivation - The most venerable, clearly understood, enlightened, and reliable constant in the world is not only that we want to be happy, but that we want only to be so. Our very nature requires it of us —Saint Augustine</strong></h6>

<h6><strong>Based on Chapter 6 - Making Profits, Rowing Across Oceans, and Changing the World - Search Inside Yourself - 14/02/15</strong></h6>

<h6><strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong></h6>
<p>Tony Hsieh, CEO of the company Zappos, created the concept of 'pleasure, passion and pain' in relation to happiness in the context of work. He believes that there is three types of happiness: 

1. Pleasure: This type of happiness is about always chasing the next high and it is a very difficult to substain this type of happiness.

2. Passion: This can also be refered to as “flow,”.This is where peak performance meets peak engagement, and time flies by.

3.Higher Purpose: This is about being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you.</p> 

<h6><strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise:</strong></h6>

<p><strong>What are your core values?</strong></p>
<p>My core values are dependablity, reliablity, loyalty, honesty, and respect.</p>

<p><strong>What do you stand for?</strong></p>
<p>I stand for honesty, equality, kindness and compassion and I try to stand by these values everyday with every interaction that I have.

<h6><strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong></h6>
<p>It was interesting to see resilience been broken up into three parts: inner calm, emotional resilience and cognitive resilance and to know that you can actually train your resilance. It seems obvious to me now after reading the chapter but prior to that I would not have thought of resilance as something you could train yourself to improve upon. The meditation exercises were an interesting approach too, again breaking it up into four parts to move through the experience and understand the physical and physiological sensations of your thoughts.</p>
