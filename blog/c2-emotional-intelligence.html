<h5>Reflecting on - Chapter 1 -Search Inside Yourself</h5>
<h6><strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong> </h6>
<p>From the first chapter, I learned a great deal more about the concept of emotional intelligence.
Emotional intelligence-(EQ) "is the ability to monitor one's own and others' feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide one's thinking and actions". Emotional Intelligence has direct benefits both intra-personally and inter-personally. The main benefits are:</p>
  <ls>
   <ul><strong>Stellar work performance</strong></ul>
   <ul><strong>Outstanding leadership</strong></ul>
   <ul><strong>The ability to create the conditions for happiness</strong></ul>
   </ls>
<p>The key to cultivating EQ is mindfulness. Mindfulness teaches us to be present, to be in the moment. Mindfulness is used to train a quality of attention that is both strong in clarity and stability.
Jon-Kabut-Zinn defines mindfulness as "paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment and non-judgmentally".</p>

<h6> <strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong></h6>
 <p>Difficult, if you are not used to this concept, it is actually very hard to just be, not physically but mentally. Shutting your mind off even for such a short period of time is really hard. My mind just wandered so easily and I had to reign it back in so many times and refocus on the task at hand which was just being. Focusing on my breathing helped as it was something to concentrate on.</p>
