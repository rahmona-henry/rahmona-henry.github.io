<h6><strong>You can make more friends in two months by becoming really
interested in other people than you can in two years by trying
to get other people interested in you. Which is just another
way of saying that the way to make a friend is to be one.
—Dale Carnegie

<h6><strong>Based on Chapter 8 - Being Effective and Loved at the Same Time - 09/03/16</strong></h6>

<h6><strong>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</strong></h6>
<p>I have experienced both compassionate and none compassionate leadership in my professional working life. Both types of leadership has points of merit but I much prefer a compassionate leadership style. I am a compassionate person myself so maybe this is why I prefer this type of leadership. From my experience, I find compassionate leaders ask their employees more questions and more importantly listen to their answers. In general, I find compassionate leaders are more supportive and approachable and their leadership style is caring and empathetic.</p>

<h6><strong>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</strong></h6>
<p>I enjoyed this type of medidation. I always try to see the goodness in others so this type of meditation felt familiar even though I had not done it before. It made me feel happy and assured that seeing goodness in everyone is a positive and thoughful attitude to have towards others.</p>

<p><strong>Do the tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</strong></p>
<p>The tonglen meditation made me feel good about myself and helpful as I was using it to help others. It is a nice to know that you can use mindfulness and meditation to potentially help others but I think it's real benefit is the fact that it can be used to help you understand others and any suffering they may be experiencing.</p>

<h6><strong>How does the SCARF model apply to your phase-0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</strong></h6>
<p>The SCARF model applies to my phase-0 experience in the following way:

Status - When I look back at my week 1 and 2 coding and where I am now there is a differnce. Not a huge difference as I am still very much a beginner but I guess my confidence in myself has increased and I am not afraid to try some new method I have found and I am more comfortbale with making mistakes or moving around pieces of code to see what works where and what does not work. I guess I have activated a status reward when comparing myself to my former self.

Certainty - There has certainly been lots of uncertainty along my phase 0 experience. Uncertainty in the actual weekly challenges, or approaches I have taken in some of my coding. Uncertainity in my abilities to complete the course, to fit in, to balance work and my personal life. There has been a lot more uncertainity then certainty along the way so far.

Autonomy - The course work and concepts in phase 0 are fairly structured but I feel there was a lot of creative and individual ways students could approach the assignment challenges and at what times and where (at home, onsite at EDA) they could complete the coursework. so I felt there was a fair balance of autonomy. 

Fairness - I feel there has been lots of fairness in phase 0. Everyone seems really friendly and helpful. People take time and effort to help others with questions and problems and everyone seems to want to progress and move forward as a group rather than individuals. 

I am not to sure how the SCARF model will apply to bootcanp - hopefully in much the same way as it has done in phase 0. </p>

<h6><strong>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</strong></h6>
<p>I have not had to have a difficult conversation lately - which is good but I will certainly keep the chapter in mind when I am having my next one.</p>
