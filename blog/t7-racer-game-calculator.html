<h4>Explain to a non-tech friend:</h4>

<h6><strong> What was your experience extending the racer car game?</strong></h6>

<p>I updated my racer car game by incorporating canvas. Canvas is an HTML element which can be used to draw graphics using scripting (usually JavaScript). I found some really good tutorials and information on the internet that helped me understand the basics of canvas and javascript. This gave me the information I needed to start extending my game. I wanted to move away from using a HTML table structure like in version 1. Using canvas, has given the game some extra moblity. Players now have four directions of movement compared to just one when using the table structure in version 1. I have also added a scoreboard so players can keep tabs on which player is in the lead during a game.</p>

<h6><strong>Did you learn anything while building the calculator?</strong></h6>

<p> I learned a lot building the calculator. I had already tried building a calculator in an earlier sprint using a Code Academy tutorial but I had failed to get the numbers and opertors to work correctly. I picked this code up again for this sprint challenge and eventually got the operators working so the calculator can now add 2 numbers together and display an answer etc. I picked up a lot of extra CSS information and know-how when building the calculators buttons and display screen. The build gave me more experience with event listeners, using the <em>this</em> keyword and the .text() and .not() methods. It was interesting to work out the logic of holding two numbers and an operator and producing a result. At the moment this is a really basic calculator that can only perform calculations using two numbers. I will work on adding more realistic functionality like decimal points, adding mulitple numbers and a percentage operator.
