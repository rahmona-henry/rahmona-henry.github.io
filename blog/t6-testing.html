<h4>Explain to a non-tech friend:</h4>

<h6><strong> What 'scope' is, and how it works in javascript</strong></h6>
<p>Javascipt has two scopes: Global and Local. Global scope can be described as follows: Any variable declared outside of a function or a piece of code designed to do a specfic job is called a global variable and can be used by any piece of code in the entire program, there is no barriers or access restriction to that variable. On the other hand local scope is any variable that is declared inside a function. Local variables can only be used by the functions they are declared within. No other piece of code apart from that function can access the local variable. Local variables are deleted when the function is completed and global variables are deleted when you close the page.</p>

<h6><strong>In the javascript language, describe all the use cases for each of:</strong></h6>

<p><strong>parentheses ()</strong></p>
<p>Parentheses or round brackets are used in Javascript to group and hold expressions and parameters. Parentheses have multiple uses relating to functions and structures in a piece of code. They are used to contain a list of parameters/items passed to functions and control structures e.g (number,times). They are also used to group expressions to control the order and flow of the codes execution. Some functions have no parameters so the parentheses will remain blank like this ().</p>

<p><strong>brackets []</strong></p>
<p>In Javascript square brackets are opertors used to access an array. JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable e.g var fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'orange']. The square brackets are used to specify a location within an array. The data at this location can be defined with the syntax array[element] = value and you refer to an array element by referring to the index number. To get an element, put it's index in square brackets. First index is 0 e.g alert(fruit[0]).</p>

<p><strong>braces {}</strong></p>
<p>Curly braces in Javascript define the beginning and end of functions blocks and statement blocks such as the for() and if() structures. Curly braces are also used for defining inital values in array declarations. When a function is called by the program all the code within the curly barces will run/execute.</p>

<p><strong>single quotes ''</strong></p>
<p>Single quotes '' are used to define a string in Javascript e.g alert('Hello World'). You can also define a string using double quotes "". In javascript single and double quotes are basically the same thing; they are used to define string literals. " and ' are interchangeable but need to be used together. There is one noticeable difference between " and'. If strings within " have a special character then that special character will need to be escaped. Example:
Variable = "hi " there"; ---> here you need to escape the " inside the string like this:
Variable = "hi \" there"; 
But if using, ' there is no need to escape (unless there is a extra ' in string). You can have the string like this: var = 'Hello " World"';</p>
