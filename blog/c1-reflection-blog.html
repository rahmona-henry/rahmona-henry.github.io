    <h5>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h5>
     <p>For me the EDC experience is one that I have actively chosen to undertake. It's not something that is expected or required or part of the job etc. We have all chosen to be here. It's a fork in the road and so far 4 days in it's been great. It is a totally different approach to education then what I am used but I am enjoying it and really excited to see where the journey goes.</p>

    <h5>What are your impressions?</h5>
     <p>So far so good! The course is going to be a lot of hard work but I am certain it will be worth it. Everyone - both students and teachers have been really friendly and extemely helpful so it has been a great positive start!</p>

    <h5>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h5>
     <p> It's going to take a little bit of practise! It's certainly very different to any other educational culture I have experienced before - but in a great way! I am looking forward to seeing how it all unfolds and the experience this new culture brings.</p>

    <h5>Have your expectations of EDA changed, if so how?</h5>
     <p>I knew the staff and the students were going to be supportive throughout the course to some degree but that level of support is much higher then my initial expectations. Everyone is so eager to help each other out in any way they can. It's really great to see such a level of support and encouragement from everyone involved.</p>

    <h5>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h5> 
     <p>Yes, I am really excited to take part. The environment is new, fast-moving, informative and energetic and yes it makes me nervous - but in a really great - I don't know what's around the next corner kind of way!</p>
